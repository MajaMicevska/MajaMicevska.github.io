I am from Macedonia. I hold a PhD in Economics from Claremont Graduate University, USA. 
My research interests are in using data science and machine learning methods to explore societal issues.

I am a founder and organizer of [Brussels Women in Machine Learning and Data Science](https://www.meetup.com/Brussels-Women-in-Machine-Learning-and-Data-Science/?msockid=218a3813df6b68e8304c2cf0de236940).
